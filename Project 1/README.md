## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2016-2020 to answer these questions:

1. In the period 2016-2020, have there been any major shifts in which countries users are from?
2. What is the gender split on Stack Overflow, and have there been any major changes between 2016-2020?
3. Looking at the 2020 data, what are the age distributions of male and female users?

The Stack Overflow survey data is not included in this repository, but is available for download on the [Stack Overflow website](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/). Please note that the file paths in the Jupyter notebook may need to be changed depending on where the data is saved relative to the file.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a single Jupyter Notebook in the repository that explores all three questions. Markdown cells are used as explanation of the steps taken to progress through the data analysis process.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

A summary of the findings is:

1. In the period 2016-2020, **there has been an increase in users from India, and a decrease in users from the USA.**
2. **Survey respondents predominantly identify as male (over 90%)**, and there are **no clear trends over time.**
3. In the 2020 data **the age distribution of female users has a narrower spread, and peaks in the 21-30 age bracket. This could indicate women earlier in their careers.**

A more thorough look at the results can be found in my blog post [here](https://guyhth.medium.com/global-shifts-and-gender-drifts-on-stack-overflow-5e2ffe71face).
